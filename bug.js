This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an incorrect `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items. If it doesn't return a unique key for each item, you might encounter unexpected behavior such as incorrect rendering, items not appearing, or performance issues.  

```javascript
// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs!
/>
```

In this example, the `id` values are not unique, leading to issues.
